# MyFavPorjects
Welcome to my repository! Here are a few of my favorite projects I've worked on over the years.
## Brute Force Sudoku
I was assigned the task to create a brute force puzzle solver that would return the solved sudoku puzzle. I had to solve a total of 5 puzzles using python.
## HackWashU
My friend and I chose to make our first ever game in pygame together for HackWashU 2022. It was a lot of fun working together for the first time and I really enjopyed making all the pixel art and working on animation and UI. We made a game where the player controlled a diver that would go around and pick up trash and deliver them to a boat to help clean the ocean. We also add a cute little dolphin that once interacted with would follow the player around. While it has many flaws, I'm supper proud of how far we had come in the 48 hours we were given.
## Java Memory Match
This was my first crack at java in High School, and for a final project I made a memory match game! It was challenging, but very fun. This was one of my first ever major projects in my coding journey.
## Vigenere Cipher Solver
I was assigned the task to make a brute force vigenere cipher decryptor to simulate how a hacker can intercepot and decrypt encrypted messages. While it is not as efficient as I would have hoped for, I am still very proud of it since this was my first project oriented towards Ciber Security
## Halloween Maze Solver
This was my first ever puzzle solver, and to top it off it was Halloween themed! We were allowed to input the dimension of the maze, the starting position of Bob the Blob, and the maze itself into an input.txt. The maze itself used '#' as a wall, 'P' as a piece of candy, 'S' as a sidewalk, and '@' as a man hole than Bob could warp to. Using recursion, I would calculate how many pieces of candy Bob was able to eat, and his final path idecated by 'B'. I had a really fun time working on this and it really helped me understand how recursion works.
